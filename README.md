# Project Overview

Improved Classification of Coronary Artery Disease through a Machine Learning Algorithm

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of heart attacks in the United States, attributable to over 50% of heart attacks every year. However, the main method of diagnosing this disease relies on the electrocardiogram (ECG), which has a very low true positive (specificity) and true negative (sensitivity) rate. As a result, patients most often undergo more intrusive tests like an angiogram or an x-ray to accurately diagnose coronary artery disease. This project proposes the use of a support vector machine algorithm to model a database of patients' vitals to classify coronary artery disease more accurately. 

# Results

Overall, the support vector machine algorithm improved upon the low accuracy and high intrusiveness of current coronary artery disease detection methods. The algorithm performed with a specificity of 91.8% compared to the current specificity of 37.5% through an ECG test, and trained the dataset with an accuracy of 92.3%. Additionally, the algorithm can be implemented in the future in conjunction with an ECG for real-time monitoring by patients.

#Award

This algorithm won Honorable Mention (3rd Place) Category Award in Physical Sciences and Engineering.
