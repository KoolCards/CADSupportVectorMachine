# Coronary Artery Disease Support Vector Machine

Improved Classification of Coronary Artery Disease through a Machine Learning Algorithm

A support vector machine algorithm that improves upon the low accuracy of current coronary artery disease detection methods. The algorithm performs with a specificity of 91.8% compared to the current specificity of 37.5% through an ECG test.
